{"home":{"content":"# Lecture 8: Developer Matchmaker\n---\n\nWelcome! **IT'S LAB DAY.**\n\n### Learning Objectives\n---\n\n**EFFING FLOATS:** HOW DO THEY WORK?!\n\nAlso, how do we apply all that we learned thus far into a cohesive, professional looking and functional website?\n\n### Instructions\n---\n\nWe are going to be building this (**with a partner**).\n\n<img style=\"width: 100%; height: auto;\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FEWDMaterials/resources/master/developer_matchmaker.png\">\n\n### Step 1\n---\n\nDiagram out the layout of your page using boxes. **Draw the diagram out on your desks**.\n\n1. I want to see a diagram similar to what we did for Sartre's List and other layout exercises.\n2. Make sure you also display which items need a clearfix parent.\n\n### Step 2\n---\n\nClear (haha, get it?) your schematic with Pete or Taq. We will be walking around to sign you off.\n\n### Step 3\n---\n\nBuild your website. Here is the **[starter kit](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/FEWD_Developer_Matchmaker)**.\n\n1. Make sure to use semantic tags such as article, section, etc\n2. **Hint**: you will need ```background-size: cover``` to solve one of the challenges.\n3. **Hint 2**: Here's the **[completed project](https://fewdmaterials.github.io/developer_matchmaker/)**. Don't cheat! But resize this page and get an understanding of how these elements need to behave. Incorporate these behaviors to your implementation\n\n\n\n\n","idx":0},"title":{"content":"Lecture 8: Developer Matchmaker","idx":1},"desc":{"content":"Lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab lab.","idx":2},"__list__":["home","title","desc"]}
